 <h1 align="center"> DEEPAK RAMESH</h1>


Hi! I am a passionate mechanical engineer and aspiring roboticist with hands-on experience working in startups and projects, currently persuing MS Robotics at Northeastern University. Areas of interest include Control Systems, SLAM, Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. 

Working for 18 months at Strider Robotics, I learnt the entire product-development cycle from a reasearch prototye to a market ready product. I was able to solve real world problems by leveraging my skills in CAD modelling, Linear and non-linear FEA, Multi-body dynamic analysis, Design for Assembly & Manufacturing and drafting engineering drawings using GD&T.
